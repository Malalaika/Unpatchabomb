# Unpatchabomb 

---
Unpatchabomb is a Lua Script for the game Word Bomb. 

---
Unpatchabomb is an unpatchable Lua Script for Word Bomb because it requires the user to input the 2-3 letters, this means any changes to the UI will not affect the script, unlike the original Word Bomb Finder, which got patched when the Word Bomb developers changed the UI Layout on Explorer.

---
Unpatchabomb is based off the Impressive work of Angeld23's Word Bomb Finder, without that script, this script would never have existed.

# Why should i use this instead of Google?
---
All you need to do is type 2-3 letters, everything else will be completely layed out for you, the word will be completely copied into your clipboard, and all you need to do now is paste it into the textbox, any used words will be thrown out of the question and the script has a library of 11,000 words, so you never run out during normal gameplay.

# What is this best Compatible with?
---
This is best compatible with commercial Paid Programs like:
Synapse X - $15 - $20 (Depends on the Payment Method)
Sentinel - $15
Protosmasher - $15
Sirhurt - $10

The Paid Programs above should work well with this Script, as they all have SetClipboard function.

Not everyone has Paid Programs however, so we have a list of Free Programs we can recommend you to use with this script.
If you cannot find these Exploits, search them up on Youtube.

Sona
KRNL/Kraken Z (They're basically the same with just one major difference)
Fluxus
Apex V2 (Avaliable at NateVang's site)
JJSploit

Even thought EasyExploits might be compatible, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND OR CONDONE THE USE OF IT.

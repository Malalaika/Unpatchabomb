# Unpatchabomb
Unpatchabomb is a Lua Script for the game Word Bomb. 
---
Unpatchabomb is an unpatchable Lua Script for Word Bomb because it requires the user to input the 2-3 letters, this means any changes to the UI will not affect the script, unlike the original Word Bomb Finder, which got patched when the Word Bomb developers changed the UI Layout on Explorer.
---
Unpatchabomb is based off the Impressive work of Angeld23's Word Bomb Finder, without that script, this script would never have existed.

# Why should i use this instead of Google?
All you need to do is type 2-3 letters, everything else will be completely layed out for you.
